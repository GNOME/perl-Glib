- old versions of ExtUtils::Depends and ExtUtils::PkgConfig don't support
  the import version checking properly, so we can't reliably detect when
  they are too old; we need a more intelligent way to check for that.

- API for finding out what version of glib we're linked against.
  - use that API to add TODO guards to 9.t and a.t (the ones that exercise
    GLib bugs on x86_64).  i think the safe versions are 2.2.5 and 2.3.3.

- documentation generation:
  - hush things up a bit, we don't need so much status info
    perhaps there should be an env var to enable these messages, or a
    "doc lint" tool.

- GEnum type for G_PRIORITY_VALUES?
- can't implement g_idle_remove_by_data because ... well, how would you
  search for the data value?
- proper cleanup for bad parameter types in Glib::Object::new?
- GValue.xs may require the ability to register handlers for new fundamental
  types, since gperl_sv_from_value and gperl_value_from_sv croak on unknown
  or unimplemented data types.
  - gperl_value_from_sv should change to void return since it croaks on error.
