=head1 NAME

Glib - Perl wrappers for the GLib utility and Object libraries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Glib;
  blah blah blah

=head1 ABSTRACT

This module provides perl access to GLib and GLib's GObject libraries.
GLib is a portability and utility library; GObject provides a generic
type system with inheritance and a powerful signal system.  Together
these libraries are used as the foundation for many of the libraries
that make up the Gnome environment, and are used in many unrelated
projects.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This wrapper attempts to provide a perlish interface while remaining
as true as possible to the underlying C API, so that any reference
materials you can find on using GLib may still apply to using the
libraries from perl.  Where GLib's functionality overlaps perl's,
perl's is favored; for example, you will find perl lists and arrays in
place of GSList or GList objects.  Some concepts have been eliminated;
you need never worry about reference-counting on GObjects or GBoxed
structures.  Other concepts have been converted to a perlish analogy;
the GType id will never be seen in perl, as the package name serves
that purpose.  [FIXME link to a document describing this stuff in detail.]

This module also provides facilities for creating wrappers for other
GObject-based libraries.  [FIXME link to a developer's doc]

This module is the basis for the Gtk2 module, so most of the references
you'll be able to find about this one are tied to that one.  The perl
interface aims to be very simply related to the C API, so see the C API
reference documentation:

  GLib - http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/
  GObject - http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/

For gtk2-perl itself, see its website at

  gtk2-perl - http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/

A mailing list exists for discussion of using gtk2-perl and related
modules.  Archives and subscription information is available at
http://lists.gnome.org/.
