Overview of Changes from Glib 1.02x to 1.030
============================================

* MakeHelper's utilities now allow "disable-doc" on a Makefile.PL command-line
  to disable doc generation.  This works for all Glib::MakeHelper-based
  projects.
* It is now possible to register new GFlags and GEnum types from Perl.
  These are typically useful as types for object properties of perl-derived
  GObjects.
* We now compile cleanly and pass tests on x86_64 platforms.  Some
  tests are skipped until bugfixes in glib hit mainstream.
  Thanks to Jacek Konieczny.
* Added documentation for tie_properties.
* ParseXSDoc now supports continuation lines in xsubs, and properly hides
  things that want to be hidden.
* Invocation of signal and event handlers no longer clobbers $@ at the
  application level.  Thanks to Thierry Vignaud.
* Added version information APIs.
* Added filename_to_uri and filename_from_uri, but they have problems with
  localization.  Need help debugging this.
* Glib is now a proper Exporter, and can export the filename utilities.
  We also allow method invocation of those functions to quell controversy.
